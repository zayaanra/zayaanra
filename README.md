## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm Zayaan Rahman, a software engineer currently working for Telaverge Communications. I have a M.S. in Computer Science from New York University and a B.S. in Computer Science from University at Buffalo.

I'm passionate about building software with AI and large language models, exploring how they can make everyday workflows smarter and more efficient. I also enjoy diving into systems programming and low-level problem solving, where performance and precision really matter. I also have experience in developing full-stack applications that utilize cloud computing technologies such as AWS.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
- [Git Detective](https://github.com/zayaanra/git-detective), a full-stack web application that allows users to connect to GitHub repositories and query them using the Google Gemini LLM
